### What is "redirect target"?

Each redirected app has its individual "redirect target" folder, reading and writing files and folders other than _Standard folder_ will be redirected to this folder. Meanwhile, this folder will be managed by Android system.

### The difference between the two options

- **Data folder**  `/Android/data/<package_name>/sdcard`

  This folder will be treated as data for the app by the Android system, counted in the storage space of the app, and will be deleted when clearing data or uninstalling.

- **Cache folder** `/Android/data/<package_name>/cache/sdcard`

  This folder will be treated as cache for the app by the Android system, counted in the storage space of the app, and will be deleted when clearing data, clearing cache or uninstalling.

  **Caution:** File stored here is very unreliable. They may be considered as obsolete cache and cleared by the cache management mechanism of Android system or cleared by third-party software at any time.

### How should I choose "redirect target"?

- When your redirected apps won't put important data into non-standard folders or you make sure important data has been redirected / saved by yourself, recommend to choose the **cache folder** as "redirect target". This allows the garbage files generated by redirected apps in external storage to be managed by the cache management mechanism of Android system.

- When your redirected apps may put important data into non-standard folders, recommend to choose the **data folder** as "redirect target".

  > **Example:**
  > 
  > WeChat writes chat pictures and files in non-standard folders. However, their server won't retain those pictures and files for a long time. Once redirected target folder is cleared, it might be hard to retrieve pictures and files in early chat. At this point, it is recommended to redirect to the data folder to ensure data security as much as possible.
