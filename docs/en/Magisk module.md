### Magisk module

#### Requirement

* Require Magisk v15+
* Module is still being tested and cannot be guaranteed
* Please confirm that you have mastered how to delete the Magisk module when you cannot enter the system
* **Some users may have the problem that all apps can't access storage after using the module**
